Demo code for interacting with GPT-3 in Python.
This code comes from an article on medium.com
https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/how-to-use-chatgpt-with-python-1213b8477f7b

To run this you need to 
* first visit openai.com and get an APIkey, which you insert into the code below.
  get the apikey at this URL https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
* next create a folder and put this file in the folder as gpt_demo.py
* finally run the following commands

% pip3 install openai  (on Mac, or pip install openai on Windows/Linux)
% python3 gpt_demo.py  (on Mac, or python gptapi.py on Windows/Linux)

The program will ask for a prompt, send it to openAI, get the response, and print it.
